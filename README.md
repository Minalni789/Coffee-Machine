# Coffee-Machine
This Python program simulates a coffee machine using the menu, coffee_maker, and money_machine modules. It displays a menu of available drinks, allows the user to select a drink, and checks if there are enough resources and money to make the drink. If so, it makes the coffee, deducts resources and money used, and provides a report of the coffee machine's status upon request.
